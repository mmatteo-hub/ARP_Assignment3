### DRONE NAME: drone_DM1

This is a simple drone, connected to the master via socket.
This drone receives as input the initial position and a path for the logfile.
It moves randomly in the 3-dimentional space.
It can move along X and Y axis or, with a lower probability, up and down on the Z axis.
Before moving it sends a request to the master that can allow or deny the movement.
If the movement is denied because there is a wall or it's not inside the map, the drone changes immediately direction.
If the movement is denied because in that position there is another drone, it sends another request of the same movement type.
The drone also can construct a map of the environment on the base of the messages received from the master.
This map is printed every time drone stops for refueling, here below the symbols and their meaning:
. -> position not yet explored;
* -> wall;
x -> position explored.
