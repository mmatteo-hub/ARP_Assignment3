### DRONE NAME: drone_MS8

This drone moves randomly across a map and marks in its own memory the positions it has 
occupied and the relative altitudes reached in all positions.

The map is set up by the master process, that also keeps track of the positions of all the other 
drones moving inside it. The drone comunicates with the master through a dedicated socket. Every 
movement deision is comunicated to the master: before an actual movement is carried out the 
drone waits for an answer by the master that comunicates back if the desired movement
interpheres with another drone's trajectory or if it drives the drone into a wall.

In both cases drone MS8 simply stops and recalculates a new random direction to follow.
If a wall was encountered however, the wall's position is marked on the drone's map. The drone will 
eventually explore the whole map, recreating its own version of the map generatd by the master.
This map is displayed to te usser along with oher status messages regarding the drone's operations.

When launching the drone's executable, 3 arguments have to be passed: 2 planar coordinates on the 
map and one integer between 1 and 20 that fixes the drone's simulated velocity. If any of the 
two coordinates are invalid or if any of these 3 arguments is missing the drone's process will 
ask the user to re-insert these values. Drone MS8 will then simulate a battery charging routine 
and a subsequent take off to a random z height. Each step the drone takes reduces slightly the 
battery, whose status is updated in real time on the processes' terminal. When the battery reaches
a value close to zero, it simulates a controlled emergency landing and updates its current altitude
while doing so.

A signal handler catches a termination signal sent to the drone and launches the process' exit 
routine, where the user gets notifieed one last time on screen and the socket connection used is closed.
All the drone's status changes and decisions are logged in a separate .txt file that will store a 
copy of all the messages shown to the user on screen.
